# Databases
An SQL based group project that was developed as a university assignment for the subject "Databases". The goal of this project is to design a relational database for a vehicle insurance company storing the data of the vecicles, the customers, the insurance contracts and the driving violations-incidents. We generated hypothetical database entries using Mockaroo for random data generation. We designed SQL queries for creating tables, managing records, filtering and defining relationships. We perform database normalization based on Third-Normal-Form (3NF) and Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF). We setup triggers and cursors to ensure data integrity and perform maintenance. Finally, we have written a program in Java using the JDBC client to simulate real world consumption of the database.

**Group members involved in this project:**<br>
Athanasios Bitakis, Dimitrios Panagiotopoulos, Avgerinos Christos.
